# lcdLib from Project 3: LCD Game
## Introduction

lcdLib provides primitives for a pixel, customShape, clearing the screen and a 8x12 font. 

shapmotion.c is a file where I tried to create a layer for my custome figure
to move (this file is incomplete)

wdt_handler.s is a file to control interrupts, framesize. (incomplete file)

lcddraw.c is a file where we create all the methods to draw our shapes or
custom figures.
